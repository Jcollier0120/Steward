# The Steward's changelog

Each version of the Steward itself, newest first, released as `v<version>`. The kit it hands out has its own changelog, [kit/CHANGELOG.md](kit/CHANGELOG.md). Versions before 0.8.1 are described in their commits and pull requests.

## 0.8.14

**A bump that fails says which test, keeps its output, and is tried once more.** The rollout of kit 2.12.1 failed for two employees with only "npm test failed (exit 1)": the log keeps the last 25 lines of the output, and the failed test was far above them.
- A failed check's message names the tests that failed and the first lines of their errors, read from `node --test`'s output (`failedTests` in run.ts), so the alarm says what broke: `npm test failed (exit 1): "its name" (each request came after its warm-up: 5 !== 8)`. The log lists them too, before the tail.
- The failed step's whole output is kept beside its worktree, as `work\<id>.log`, and the message says where.
- A bump's checks that fail are run once more, as a PR's tested here are: Reeve's failed in the round, under the load of several bumps at once, and passed three times alone. A pass the second time is committed, and its result and commit message say so; failing twice is the failure, as before.

## 0.8.13

**Kit 2.13.1: an update that moves an agent's port ends the old page.** The Steward hands out kit 2.13.1 (kit/CHANGELOG.md). An agent's installer now finds its running page on the port server.json recorded, as well as its own, and stops it there.

## 0.8.12

**The Chamberlain is an employee.** The manor's new hire for its private papers (Jcollier0120/Chamberlain) is built on the kit as the other hires are, and the Steward now rolls the kit out to it, merges its PRs and publishes its releases. Manor offers it from its release's `manor-agent.json` (Manor 0.4.35), not from its own staff.json.

## 0.8.11

**Kit 2.13.0: the NPU first.** The Steward hands out kit 2.13.0 (kit/CHANGELOG.md): model work goes to the NPU whenever it can do it, busy or not, and to a graphics card or the processor only when it can't.

## 0.8.10

**Kit 2.12.1: a release zip's name has no spaces.** The Steward hands out kit 2.12.1 (kit/CHANGELOG.md). An agent whose name has two words (the Developer Herald) now publishes a zip that GitHub stores under the name SHA256SUMS.txt gives it, and that Manor finds.

## 0.8.9

**The Developer Herald is an employee.** It is the Herald's developer half since Herald 0.5.0, and the Steward now looks after it as it does the Smith: it rolls the kit out to it, merges its PRs and publishes its releases. A name of two words gives the id `developer-herald` and the repository and checkout `DeveloperHerald`.

## 0.8.8

**Kit 2.12.0: a release publishes manor-agent.json, when the agent's checkout has one.** The Steward hands out kit 2.12.0 (kit/CHANGELOG.md): `npm run release -- --publish` copies the checkout's `manor-agent.json` beside the zip, lists it in SHA256SUMS.txt and uploads it, so Manor 0.4.35 offers the agent for hire; and it refuses to build when the file names another repository than origin's, or another agent. (0.8.7 was kit 2.11.0's, for the Smith.)

## 0.8.6

**The Wright's drafts wait for the Bailiff, where it is installed.** The Bailiff (ours alone, like the Wright) reviews each of the Wright's drafts with Claude Code, read-only, and labels it `bailiff:approved` or `bailiff:changes`, with a comment ending in a marker that names the head commit it reviewed.

- Where `%USERPROFILE%\.bailiff\app` (or `BAILIFF_HOME`'s) exists, a draft that passes the Steward's code-only look is marked ready only when it carries `bailiff:approved` and the Bailiff's last marked comment by the team approves its current head. Otherwise it stays a draft, and its hold says why (`a draft from the Wright, with the Bailiff: …`). Without the Bailiff, nothing changes.
- The Bailiff is an employee, and its `GET /api/reviews` an alarm source (Claude Code unusable, a review failing twice, its page down), only where it is installed: new setting **The Bailiff's page** (`alarms.bailiffUrl`).
- Numbered 0.8.6, after 0.8.5 (kit 2.10.0) on main.
## 0.8.5

**Kit 2.10.0: Manor's gpuWithNpu keeps the graphics card out of model work beside an NPU.** The Steward hands out kit 2.10.0 (kit/CHANGELOG.md): with Manor's "Use the graphics card for models when there's an NPU" off and an NPU configured, no graphics card is chosen for a request, not even as the fallback. On by default. (0.8.4 is the Bailiff PR's.)

## 0.8.3

**The Aletaster's release gate, Reeve's alerts as alarms, and the Steward's own kit PRs caught up.**

- **A release waits for a passing tasting.** Before it publishes an employee's release (a round's, a merged PR's, or the Release button's), the Steward asks the Aletaster to taste the very commit it would release from (`POST /api/taste` with the page's token, then `GET /api/taste?id=…` every two seconds for up to 90 seconds), and publishes only when the tasting is done and lets it through (`release: true`: a pass, or a warning unless the Aletaster's own settings say warnings hold). Anything else holds the release, with the tasting's reason; the round looks at that employee again next round, whatever GitHub says.
  - It never deadlocks. With no Aletaster installed, or one off duty for Developer options (Manor's switch off, and the Aletaster a developer role in Manor's staff.json), the release goes with "released without a tasting: the Aletaster isn't here". With an Aletaster that predates `/api/taste` (its POST answers the route's own 404, with no `verdict`), or whose page doesn't answer at all, it goes with a note too. The Aletaster's own release is never held by its tasting, so a broken Aletaster can always be fixed.
  - A release held longer than **A release the Aletaster's tasting holds for** (`alarms.tastingHours`, 6 hours) is an alarm, with the reason and a link to the tasting. The holds are kept in `tasting-held.json`.
  - New setting **Waits for the Aletaster's tasting** (`tasteBeforeRelease`), on by default.
- **Reeve's alerts are alarms.** Each round reads Reeve's `GET /api/alerts` (where Reeve is installed; **Reeve's page**, `alarms.reeveUrl`, `http://127.0.0.1:18383`): one alarm per open alert of his jobs, at once, `reeve:<id>`, with his title, detail, link and since, and the Steward's Windows notification, since Reeve raises none of his own when Manor and the Steward are installed. An older Reeve without the endpoint, or his page down, is quiet (the Surveyor already reports his page down).
  - **One alarm for one crashed job.** The Surveyor reports a Reeve job that exited non-zero as the problem `agent.reeve.job.<job>`. While Reeve's alerts name that job, the Surveyor's condition for it is dropped and Reeve's stands; with no answer from Reeve, the Surveyor's stays.
- **The Steward's own kit PRs are caught up.** A round no longer leaves a `steward/kit-…` PR waiting as conflicting when a team PR took its version (Reeve#39): it is caught up by the team's rules (its branch merged in, a conflict resolved only in its version lines, the next free version), its kit filled again and the employee's checks run, then pushed, with a comment. One that conflicts beyond its version files is closed with its branch deleted, and the next round's rollout bumps the employee again from its branch's head.

## 0.8.2

The automatic rollout and self-release described under 0.8.1, as released: #34 (kit 2.9.1, an NPU turn skips its warm-up while the model is loaded) and #35 both raised the Steward to 0.8.1, and #34 was released as v0.8.1 first, so v0.8.1 doesn't carry #35. #36 released #35 as 0.8.2.

## 0.8.1

**The Steward rolls out a new kit by itself, and releases its own new versions.** Until now a round merged ready PRs, caught branches up, looked at the Wright's drafts and released the employees' new versions, but a new kit still needed a person: `npm run kit-release -- --publish`, then `steward bump` and `steward push`. Now the round does it.

- **The rollout in a round.** When the newest kit release is newer than the kit an employee's branch pins, and the employee has no kit PR of the Steward's open and no bump to that kit that failed at its branch's head, the round bumps it and pushes its PR, a few employees at a time. Later rounds merge and release that PR as any of the Steward's.
  - A bump whose checks fail, or a push that fails, raises an alarm at once. That kit isn't tried again until a new commit lands on the employee's branch, or a person presses Bump or Push (or runs the command). A newer kit is tried at once.
  - It waits while the Steward itself carries an older kit than the newest release, because a bump hands out the Steward's own tools/kit.ts. A kit that waits that way for a day raises an alarm.
  - The decision reads only the round's glance at GitHub (the kit releases, the open PRs) and each employee's kit.json on its branch, fetched only when the branch moved: no GitHub call of its own.
  - New setting **Rolls out a new kit by itself** (`rollout`), on by default.
- **Its own releases.** When the Steward's main carries a kit version with no `kit-v` release, or a Steward version with no `v` release, the round releases it as a person would, kit first, with the repository's own scripts.
  - Each release is made in a fresh worktree of the Steward's checkout at that commit of origin/main. A release carries only what is committed on main, so the Wright is never in anything published from here.
  - It never releases from an unclean tree, never a version already released, and never one that isn't above the newest release of its kind. A Steward version waits for its kit's release.
  - A release that fails raises an alarm at once, and isn't tried again until main moves. A Steward release tells Manor, as an employee's does, so Manor installs it within minutes.
  - New settings **Releases its own new versions** (`releaseSelf`, on by default) and **The Steward's checkout** (`stewardCheckout`, `C:\Projects\Steward`).
- **The glance reads more.** The round's one GitHub query also reads the Steward's main: its head, kit/VERSION and package.json's version. A new kit release, or the Steward now carrying a newer kit, counts as something new for every employee, so the round looks at all of them. The hourly full look, Run now, and a round without a glance all cover the rollout.
- **New files** in the data folder: `rollout-failed.json` and `self-failed.json`, which hold what the rounds won't try again.
